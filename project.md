# TODO


- Work out how you want to do history / rollback
    - This should be easy until you want to add section evaluation (Then you need a working file that has commands appended to it)

- Come up with list of simplified api for threejs
    - Start with spawning / manipulating objects
    - Work out the best way to make mutable changes to the render loop.
    - Think about camera manipulation

- API for easy midi binding / unbinding

- flesh out temporal api with new funcs

- make the threejs api more ergonomic

- get midi hooked up
