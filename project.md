# TODO

- Work out how you want to do history / rollback
    - This should be easy until you want to add section evaluation (Then you need a working file that has commands appended to it)

- swap out stack for a queue 

- Add the eval section shortcut
    - I think for now I can just have everything send the full buffer
    - Will need to see how this plays out the the three scene as it is very stateful
